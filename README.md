# Impact of cache on data-sharingin multi-threaded programmes

## MSc thesis
This project is source code for my [MSc thesis](https://bazilinskyy.github.io/papers/bazilinskyy2014impact.pdf). The joint degree was obtained at [St Andrews Unviversity](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk)/[Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie).

## Description
The source code is located in the folder "code". The experimental environment and experiments are located in the folder "code/src". Additional testing programmes are located in other sub-folders of the "code" folder. Both the main programme used to conduct experiments and all testing programmes are discussed in detail in the report (may be found in folder "report"), in particular in chapters 4 and 5.

Organisation of the "code/src" folder is discussed in the report, section 4.1 Organisation of Solution.

Instructions on running programmes are provided in comments in the source code. Instructions on running the main programme ("code/src") are also mentioned in section 5.3 of the report.
